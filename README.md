# XTChat: A high performance, highly functional chat server.
An epoll based server with channels and the ability to handle thousands on simultaneous connections, even on consumer grade hardware.

## Tech Stack:
TCP for connections, epoll for monitoring. Rest is pure C++

## Requirements: 
Linux is all you need, as epoll is a kernel feature. And maybe a compiler.
